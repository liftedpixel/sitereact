<p>So you heard about <a href="http://liftedpixel.net/pixelplanet">Pixel Planet</a>, my <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenSimulator grid</a>, and you wanted to check it out?  This page will tell you how to register an account and install the software you need to connect and participate.  If you have further questions after going through these directions, including things not covered here, please send me an email: liftedpixel@gmail.com</p>

<p><br>
<I>What we're going to do</I><br>
-Apply for an account<br>
-Download and install Firestorm<br>
-Enter the grid details<br>
-Log in<br>
<br>
<h2>Register an account</h2>
<p>Unless you have an existing, hypergrid-enabled account on another OpenSimulator grid, you will need to create one.  Accounts have to be manually approved, but I check my email pretty frequently for registration notices.  Feel free to send me a message on <a href="http://liftedpixel.net/jessicapixel.php">any social network we share</a> for a faster approval.</p>
<br>
<p>Head to the <a href="http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Wifi">wifi page</a> for Pixel Planet located here: <a href="http://pixelplanet.online:9000/wifi">http://pixelplanet.online:9000/wifi</a>.  Under the Main Menu, click the link <a href="http://pixelplanet.online:9000/wifi/user/account/">Create Account</a>.  Please take note of the information on this page, specifically regarding the security of your account.</p>
<br>
<p>You will need to enter a first and last name to act as your username.  You may use your real life name, but it is not required.  You will also need to enter an email address and a password for the account.  Please understand that this password is stored on a MySQL database running on my home computer.  Do not reuse a password that you use elsewhere, especially not the one you use to log into the email address normally.  You are also asked to select your starting avatar: Female, Male, or Neutral.  This option controls your initial appearance, but you have full control to change your appearance later.</p>
<br>
<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> the Pixel Planet wifi page (including registration) will not be available if the server (my home computer) is offline.  If you have any issues with registration, please email me.</p>
<br>
<h2>Install an OpenSim client</h2>
<p>There are several different clients available to connect to OpenSimulator/Second Life.  As you get better with OpenSim, I encourage you to <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Third_Party_Viewer_Directory">take a look at the different clients out there</a> and find the one that works best for you.  My preferred (graphical) viewer is Firestorm.  Connecting using other clients should be similar, but I'll walk you though using Firestorm.</p>
<br>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="http://www.firestormviewer.org/downloads/">Firestorm download page</a> and select your operating system.  On the next page, choose the download link for the 'For SL &amp; Opensim' version of the program.  <i>If you are unsure if you should download the 32bit or 64bit version, download the 32bit version.</i>  Be sure to unblock the download before installing and install it.  Once it's installed, run it.</p>

<p>Clicking the Pixel Planet entry on the grid list should show the following information.  You are welcome to remove any other grids you do not connect to - they can be added back later if needed.  Click OK and it's time to log in (if your account creation has been approved).  Again, please feel free to email me if you have any issues with account creation.</p>

<p>For the <i>Username</i>, enter your first and last name with a space between them, like 'normal'.  The username is not case sensitive for logging in.  Enter your password (it IS case sensitive), and select Pixel Planet from the 'Log into Grid' pull down menu before clicking log in.</p>
