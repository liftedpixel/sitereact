One of my favorite things to do in Second Life is rez a bunch of boxes, set them to physical, and then knock them over.  Walking into them is pretty fun, but it's more fun to drive into them with a vehicle.  The problem is you have to clean up all the blocks when you're done.
<br /><br />
Well, the solution is here with <b>[LP] BLOCK WALL</b>!  Now you can easily make a wall of whatever size you want, knock it over, and then reset it at the push of a button.  When you're done, you can just as easily clean up the blocks and be on your way.<br /><br />
