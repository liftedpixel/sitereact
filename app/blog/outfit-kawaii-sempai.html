<p>I saw this jumper that says 'Kawaii in the streets, Sempai in the sheets' on Plurk and had to have it.  For only $5L it was a pretty sweet deal, too.  [ parfait. ], the store it's from, is one I had not been in before and it's been added to <a href="http://liftedpixel.net/slist.html">the list</a>.  The store has lots of kawaii stuff like frilly maid dresses and polo shirts with Pokemon designs.  It's definitely worth checking out if you're into that kind of thing.</p>
<br />
<p>Since this is my first fashion blog post in a long time, let me tell you about my 'fashion sense'.  I am not one to spend a lot of money in Second Life.  I mostly pay for land and that's it.  When I make an outfit, it's usually a bunch of old items I still like together with a few new items I have purchased.  There are only a few modern pieces in this outfit, if you can't tell.</p>
<br />
<p>The M3 anime head by Utilizator is a relatively new purchase for me.  I'm not really into mesh body parts, but I thought I'd give it a try because it looked really fun.  I'm not an anime all the time, but it's a fun accessory.  There is a weird line in the middle of the nose with most appliers, but some people might like it.  The lipstick is a free applier I picked up from a store at <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Peaceful%20Haven/128/128/2">Annie May Haven</a>.  If you like looking at creative, well put together avatars, consider sitting around AMH for a bit.</p>
