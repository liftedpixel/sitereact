As usual, I saw an article of clothing on Plurk and decided I needed to have it.  This time it was a long sleeved crop top with an axolotl print by Le Primitif.  After trying on the demo, I was a little hesitant to actually buy it because the mesh has some <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tho&defid=9011">major THO</a> and my avatar is usually pretty reserved when it comes to that sort of stuff.  The nips aren't as noticeable on the actual shirt once the axolotl pattern comes into play, so I don't mind it too much.  The seams on the inside of the arms don't line up at all, but it's still a really cute shirt.<br /><br />
Yesterday, I managed to get these high-top platform sneakers by COCO from a gatcha at The Chapter Four.  I would have been cool with any of the colors except the camo patterns, but I was super excited to get a color I actually like on the first try.  I'm also excited to find cool shoes that don't require mesh feet because I haven't jumped on the mesh body part bandwagon yet.<br /><br />
This outfit is mostly recent items, which is pretty different for me.  Here's the credits:<br /><br />
