During the month of August on the <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Hakoniwa/164/128/23">Hakoniwa</a> sim, an event called <a href="http://kagami2014.wix.com/secondlife">KAGAMI</a> is running.  It's a combination shopping event and horror game and it's worth checking out if you're a fan of Japanese monsters, exclusive shopping events, or you like games in Second Life.  I'm pretty sure the game uses the new <a href="http://community.secondlife.com/t5/English-Knowledge-Base/Experiences-in-Second-Life/ta-p/2744686">experience keys</a> feature to control your camera and teleport you around the sim and it works really well (other than the <a href="http://i.gyazo.com/190776c1fda52c6ac79d5e5bcfcbddd0.png">little teleport message</a> I can't seem to figure out how to disable).  There are a few times where it pans your camera around the area and you can see everyone running around.  I was extremely impressed with the game system.

The whole experience took me about 2 hours from start to finish and I was grinning big the whole time.  The dialog from the monsters is charming, partially because of the copious amounts of engrish.  As you work through the story, you also find and click glowing jars to release the souls of a bunch of Japanese ghosts.  When you free them, you collect their cards, and if you get all 50 cards, you get a gift book that recounts your whole adventure.  One of the monsters you talk to during the game will give you a map that shows you were the jars are hiding, so it's not too difficult.  It's definitely easier than most hunts in SL, but you'll still need to peek around some corners or look on the roofs of buildings to find them all.

The shops have Japanese horror themed items, home and garden items, and some traditional Japanese fashion like kimonos and the like.  There are even a few freebies, like a spiked bra outfit from <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Bare%20Rose/146/11/30">Bare Rose</a>, a ghost leg table from <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Camomile/89/20/22">DownDownDown</a>, and a cute kappa statue from <a href="http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/SARAN/147/65/509">Mi Gallery</a>.  There are also a few trinkets you can pick up during the game like yo-yo water balloons and weird food-on-a-stick like rats and scorpions.  The monsters probably think that stuff is good, but I'll pass.

One of the most important things is to make sure your script memory is LOW or you will get kicked from the sim.  It seems a little strict, but I was able to play through the game with minimal lag so their diligence paid off.  Most of the players I saw were dressed to match the theme of the event in kimonos, hakamas, or like monsters themselves.  It was really fun and I hope <a href="https://my.secondlife.com/nao.adagio">NAO Adagio</a> and crew whip up another cool event soon.
